This is a project where i make a card game. Backend is in Spring boot with java and frontend is in React with typescript

This is a card game in which players can build decks with created cards. In the duel, there are two players who fight each other. In each move, a player can play one card or pass. If both players pass, the one with more points on the board wins. The player who wins two rounds wins the game. <br>

Fireball - Deals damage to an enemy card. <br>
Archer - A unit that can be placed and deals damage to an enemy card. <br>
Conflagration - Burns all cards with maximum points. <br>
Healer - Boosts every card on the player's board that has no more than 2 points. <br>
Booster - Boosts a single player card. <br>
Leader - Boosts every card in one row. <br>
Doubler - Doubles chosen card points. <br>
