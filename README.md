This is a project where i make a card game. Backend is in Spring boot with java and frontend is in React with typescript. To store important
data such as username, i used react redux. For multiplayer with STOMP i used Spring web sockets on backend, and SockJS on frontend.
To store users decks i used PostgreSQL and JPA/Hibernate. 

This is card game based on rules of Gwint: The witcher card game.

In each move, a player can play one card or pass. If both players pass, the one with more points on the board wins. The player who wins two rounds wins the game. <br>

Currently, there are about 15 cards. Most of them dont have any effects, but not all. <br>
Fireball - Deals damage to an enemy card. <br>
Archer - A unit that can be placed and deals damage to an enemy card. <br>
Conflagration - Burns all cards with maximum points. <br>
Healer - Boosts every card on the player's board that has no more than 2 points. <br>
Booster - Boosts a single player card. <br>
Leader - Boosts every card in one row. <br>
Doubler - Doubles chosen card points. <br>
Rip - deals damage to whole row <br>
Rain - deals damage to max points card every turn <br>
Sharpshooter - deals damage to one enemy card and if this card dies, sharpshooter boost itself <br>
Cow - If cow dies, spawn chort in the same row <br>
Trebuchet - Deal i damage to random enemy every 2 turns<br>
Good person - Boost card on your board every 2 turns<br>
Gravedigger - Boost by number of cards on your graveyard on deploy<br>
Witch - Ressurect card from your graveyard<br>

<br>You can play cards in a chain, for example, play a card that allows you to choose another card from the deck, which you can then play.<br>
I played Priest, and a card from the deck that can be played appeared. I will choose to play a Healer.
![image](https://github.com/PiotrJagla/MyCardGame-MainProj/assets/76881722/c0779dd1-cc99-47a2-8dc0-899f784035ea)

Now, after choosing Healer, I can play this card as shown on the screen below. While playing Healer, I can't play any other cards from my hand.

After playing healer, all cards with max 2 points are boosted. (I am super excited about this feature because there was a little bit of thinking on how to implement that, and voil√†!) But apart from this, it's just a cool functionality.
![image](https://github.com/PiotrJagla/MyCardGame-MainProj/assets/76881722/715b30dd-d62f-4776-8c7c-ea060c3dacf1)

After someone wins round, there appears a crown in the middle left on the proper side. <br>
Player won 2 rounds, 2 crowns appeared and won game <br>

<br>If both players had same amount of points, they both score a crown. Here two players had same amount of points and game ended with draw<br>
