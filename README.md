This is a project where i make a card game. Backend is in Spring boot with java and frontend is in React with typescript. To store important
data such as username, i used react redux. For multiplayer handling with STOMP i used Spring web sockets on backend, and SockJS on frontend.

This is card game based on rules of Gwint: The witcher card game.

In each move, a player can play one card or pass. If both players pass, the one with more points on the board wins. The player who wins two rounds wins the game. <br>

Currently, there are about 15 cards. Most of them dont have any effects, but not all. <br>
Fireball - Deals damage to an enemy card. <br>
Archer - A unit that can be placed and deals damage to an enemy card. <br>
Conflagration - Burns all cards with maximum points. <br>
Healer - Boosts every card on the player's board that has no more than 2 points. <br>
Booster - Boosts a single player card. <br>
Leader - Boosts every card in one row. <br>
Doubler - Doubles chosen card points. <br>
Rip - deals damage to whole row <br>
Rain - deals damage to max points card every turn <br>
