This is a project where i make a card game. Backend is in Spring boot with java and frontend is in React with typescript. To store important
data such as username, i used react redux. For multiplayer handling with STOMP i used Spring web sockets on backend, and SockJS on frontend.
To store users decks i used PostgreSQL and Java JDBC api. 

This is card game based on rules of Gwint: The witcher card game.

In each move, a player can play one card or pass. If both players pass, the one with more points on the board wins. The player who wins two rounds wins the game. <br>

Currently, there are about 15 cards. Most of them dont have any effects, but not all. <br>
Fireball - Deals damage to an enemy card. <br>
Archer - A unit that can be placed and deals damage to an enemy card. <br>
Conflagration - Burns all cards with maximum points. <br>
Healer - Boosts every card on the player's board that has no more than 2 points. <br>
Booster - Boosts a single player card. <br>
Leader - Boosts every card in one row. <br>
Doubler - Doubles chosen card points. <br>
Rip - deals damage to whole row <br>
Rain - deals damage to max points card every turn <br>

This is multiplayer game, so when you click find enemy, there has to be other player waiting for fight to start a game (normally this ring on bottom is rotating).<br>

Before you find an enemy, you have to choose which deck you want to use, and if this deck is not build correctly, you can't start Duel. <br>

<br>You can play cards in a chain, for example, play a card that allows you to choose another card from the deck, which you can then play.
(this feature is in development for now, not ready for production)<br>
I played Priest, and a card from the deck that can be played appeared. I will choose to play an Archer.

Now, after choosing Archer, I can play this card as shown on the screen below. While playing Archer, I can't play any other cards from my hand.

Archer played and dealt 3 damage to the Viking. (I am super excited about this feature because there was a little bit of thinking on how to implement that, and voil√†!) But apart from this, it's just a cool functionality.

<br>After someone puts effect on row, for example rain that deals damage every turn, this is shown as below with corresponding background image.<br>

Player lost 2 rounds and lost game <br>

After someone wins round, there appears a crown in the middle left on the proper side. <br>
Player won 2 rounds, 2 crowns appeared and won game <br>

<br>If both players had same amount of points, they both scores a crown. Here two players had same points and game ended with draw<br>
